## 📂 Structure
- *Assignment 1* → [CompareBooks.java]
 The Book class includes a method hasSameISBN(Book other) that compares two book objects using their ISBN (a unique identifier   for books). It returns true if both books have the same ISBN, otherwise false.  
- *Assignment 2* → [TemperatureConverterApp.java]
    This Java program converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
      ->Takes input in one scale (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
      ->Applies the conversion formula.
      -> Displays the converted value to the user.
          Formula Used:
             °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
             °C = (°F − 32) × 5/9---
- *Assignment 3* → [ThreadExample.java]
This Java program demonstrates **basic thread creation** using the `Thread` class.

    Defines a class that extends `Thread` and overrides the `run()` method.
    Creates and starts a child thread alongside the main thread.
    Both threads execute concurrently, displaying their respective outputs.
    Uses `Thread.sleep()` to simulate pauses and observe multithreading behavior.
