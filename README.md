## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- *Assignment 1* â†’ [CompareBooks.java]
 The Book class includes a method hasSameISBN(Book other) that compares two book objects using their ISBN (a unique identifier   for books). It returns true if both books have the same ISBN, otherwise false.  
- *Assignment 2* â†’ [TemperatureConverterApp.java]
    This Java program converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
      ->Takes input in one scale (Celsius/Fahrenheit).
      ->Applies the conversion formula.
      -> Displays the converted value to the user.
          Formula Used:
             Â°F = (Â°C Ã— 9/5) + 32
             Â°C = (Â°F âˆ’ 32) Ã— 5/9---
- *Assignment 3* â†’ [ThreadExample.java]
This Java program demonstrates **basic thread creation** using the `Thread` class.

    Defines a class that extends `Thread` and overrides the `run()` method.
    Creates and starts a child thread alongside the main thread.
    Both threads execute concurrently, displaying their respective outputs.
    Uses `Thread.sleep()` to simulate pauses and observe multithreading behavior.
- *Assignment 4* â†’ [DeleteRecord.java]

The DeleteRecord program demonstrates how to use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect a Java application with a database and delete a specific record based on a given Student ID.

It establishes a connection with the database using the MySQL JDBC driver, takes the student ID as user input, and performs a DELETE operation on the students table. The program then displays a message indicating whether the record was successfully deleted or not found.
