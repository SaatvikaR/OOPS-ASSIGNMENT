# Assignment 1 â€” Compare Books by ISBN

## ðŸ“„ Description
This program defines a `Book` class with attributes `title`, `author`, and `isbn`.  
It implements a method `hasSameISBN(Book otherBook)` to compare two book objects based on their ISBN numbers.  
If the ISBNs are the same, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.  
The `main` method creates multiple book objects and demonstrates the comparison functionality by printing whether the books have the same ISBN.
